                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">	HOW TO RECYCLE AEROSOLS<br>
																	Ensure aerosols are completely empty before recycling<br>
																	Do not pierce, crush or flatten aerosol cans  <br>
																	Detach any loose or easily removable parts, such as the lid, and dispose of them with the rest of your recycling<br><br><br> 
																	WHAT ARE AEROSOLS MADE FROM?<br>
																	Around 60% of aerosols are made from tinplated steel and approx 40% are made from aluminium. Both of these metals are recyclable. Aerosols also contain some small plastic and rubber components including the lid, valve and dip tube which are extracted in the recycling process.

						<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">HOW TO RECYCLE FOIL<br>
																	Rinse or wipe off any crumbs or food residue from foil trays. To rinse just dunk the tray in the washing up water - no need to run the tap.<br>
																	Scrunch kitchen foil, tub and pot lids and wrappers together to form a ball - the bigger the ball, the easier it is to recycle.<br><br>
																	As well as foil, you can usually recycle these other aluminium items:<br><br>
																	Drinks cans<br>
																	Screw top lids from wine bottles (recycle with the bottle - the cap can be left on)<br>
																	Takeaway containers and barbeque trays.<br>

				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">CAN PET BEDDING BE RECYCLED?<br>
																	Check with your District Council (kerbside) or County Council (HWRC) whether they accept pet bedding. Some local authorities may allow used hay, straw and sawdust bedding from 'vegetarian' animals such as rabbits or guinea pigs to be put in garden waste collections, or accept it with garden waste at Household Waste Recycling Centres.<br><br>
																	CAN I RECYCLE PET BEDS OR BLANKETS?<br>
																	Old pet blankets or beds made from fabric can be recycled with textiles at a recycling centre.
																	Plastic animal beds should be recycled with plastics - ask an operative at the Recycling Centre to find out which container to put it in.

				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">When sinks, toilets and baths are cracked, badly chipped or generally past their best and cannot be re-purposed or re-sold they can be disposed of at your local Household Waste Recycling Centre (HWRC), otherwise known as 'the tip'.<br>

				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">WHICH TYPES OF BATTERIES CAN BE RECYCLED?<br>
																	All household batteries including 'button' batteries from watches.<br>
																	Battery packs from laptops, mobile phones, power tools and remote control units.<br>
																	Car batteries should be recycled at designated collection points.<br><br>
																	WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?<br>
																	Use rechargeable batteries wherever possible or plug electrical equipment into the mains electricity
																	Try to buy appliances that use renewable energy - a wind-up radio or torch, dynamo bicycle lights or a solar powered calculator.

												<p id="blockquote" class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">BICYCLES</p>
				  
				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">Even bicycles in poor condition can be repaired, refurbished and re-used. However if your bicycle is beyond repair the main parts of your old bike can be recycled at your nearest recycling centre.<br><br>
																	HOW TO RECYCLE A BICYCLE IN GOOD CONDITION<br>
																	Donate it to charity - search our Recycling Locator or contact your local council for your nearest re-use organisation. Some not-for-profit organisations collect unwanted bicycles or parts and then sell on refurbished bikes to low income citizens at reduced prices.<br><br>
																	HOW TO RECYCLE A BICYCLE PAST ITS BEST<br>
																	If your bike is beyond repair, you can recycle the metal parts. Many local recycling centres have a mixed metals recycling facility - find your nearest by entering your postcode into our Recycling Locator.

												<p id="blockquote" class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">CARS<p>
				  
				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s"><br>Cars are predominately made from metal which is recyclable. Search online for companies who recycle vehicles, or check the car section in your local paper or telephone directory.<br><br>
																	If your car is in a road-worthy condition, you may be able to sell it privately or trade-in when you buy a new one.<br><br>
																	If your car is at the end of its life, you may find a local scrap dealer who is willing to buy it from you or you could donate it to charity via schemes such as Charity Car and Giveacar.<br><br><br>
																	
																	
																	In 2005 the End of Life Vehicle Regulations made car makers individually responsible for giving customers who own cars of their brands, the opportunity to dispose of them in a safe, legal and environmentally friendly way when they reach the end of their useful life.  When scrap prices are low, this service must also be provided free of charge. There are a number of organisation that provide this service for the car makers â€“ search online for 'recycling cars'.

												<p id="blockquote" class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">ELECTRICAL ITEMS</p>
				  
				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">Some local authorities collect small electrical items as part of their kerbside collection, otherwise you can recycle these and larger items at selected retailers and at Household Waste Recycling Centres.<br><br>
																<br>Lots of items fall into this category including alarm clocks; CD/DVD players and game consoles; small kitchen appliances such as kettles, toasters and blenders; personal grooming products like hairdryers, straighteners, electric toothbrushes and shavers; garden tools such as lawnmowers and shredders; other items such as lamps, torches, vacuum cleaners, phones, radios, TVs, printers, cameras and smoke alarms.<br><br>

																It's easy to check if an electrical item, toy or game is recyclable if it reached the end of its working life. Simply ask the following questions and if the answer is yes, to any of these, it is recyclable:<br>
																Does it have a plug?<br>
																Does it use batteries?<br>
																Does it need charging?<br>
																Does it have a picture of a crossed out wheelie bin on it?<br>

				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">HOW TO RECYCLE FURNITURE<br>
																	Furniture at the end of its useful life can often be recycled, especially items made from wood and metal. Most furniture can be recycled at your local recycling centre and some local authorities may also provide a collection service.<br><br>
																	If you would like to recycle your old bed and are willing to pay to do so, you can use a service called â€˜Collect your old bedâ€™. Every part of the bed is recycled - springs, wooden frames and filling materials, and most of these materials are used elsewhere in the furniture industry.<br><br>
																	
																	Send your bed for recycling!<br><br>
																	
																	WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?<br><br>
																	
																	If you have a piece of furniture that is still usable, you could consider selling it, passing it on to someone else or donating it - some charity shops accept furniture for re-sale.<br><br>
																	
																	Not all items of furniture can be re-sold by charity shops so it is worth checking in advance. British Heart Foundation offer free furniture collections  find out about checking fire labels, and which items they can and cannot collect.

												<p id="blockquote" class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">CLOTHING & TEXTILES</p>
				  
				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">We all have clothes or textiles such as curtains, duvet covers and blankets that we donâ€™t want any more or are past their best.<br><br>

																Clothes and textiles that are in good condition can be donated and sold for re-use. Items that arenâ€™t suitable to be passed onto someone else can be recycled and made into new items, such as padding for chairs and car seats, cleaning cloths and industrial blankets.<br><br>
																															
																HOW TO RECYCLE UNWANTED CLOTHES & TEXTILES<br><br>
																Check to see if your council collects clothes and textiles to be recycled.<br>
																Drop off your unwanted items at recycling points and clothing and textile banks in supermarket and local car parks â€“ find your nearest one using our Recycling Locator tool.<br>
																Donate items to charity and re-use organisations in-store or using bags that come through the door. The Charity Retail website will help you to find your nearest charity shop.<br>
																If you are fundraising for your school, church or organisations such as Girl Guides or Scouts, there are textile companies who can arrange a collection to help you to raise money for your cause.	<br>

												<p id="blockquote" class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">FOOD WASTE</p>
				  
				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">HOW SHOULD I RECYCLE FOOD WASTE?<br>
																If your local authority has given you a kitchen caddy to collect food waste, you can usually recycle any cooked or raw food scraps <br>
																Make sure you remove all packaging from your food waste, especially plastic<br><br>
																The collected food waste can be treated in several ways. In some areas (where food and garden waste are mixed together) it is often commercially composted at a local facility. This compost is then used in agriculture, landscaping and horticulture. Where food waste is collected separately it is usually treated using a method called anaerobic digestion, which produces green electricity.<br>

												<p id="blockquote" class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">GAS BOTTLES</p>
				  
				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">Gas bottles can be refilled for further use and should be returned to the supplier. Please do not place gas cylinders in your dustbin or in the containers at your household waste recycling centre as they may explode if they are crushed. <br>

												<p id="blockquote" class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">WRAPPING PAPER</p>
				  
				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">Some councils will accept wrapping paper in their household recycling collection scheme but others will not, so please check with them first.<br>
																Some local authorities accept wrapping paper in home recycling collections<br>
																Others ask for wrapping paper to be taken to the local recycling centre<br>
																Some do not collect wrapping paper at all because wrapping paper is not accepted by some recycled paper mills. There are a number of reasons for this.<br><br>
																The materials that go into making some wrapping paper result in it not always being accepted for recycling:<br>
																Wrapping paper is often dyed, laminated and/or contains non-paper additives such as gold and silver coloured shapes, glitter, plastics etc which cannot be recycled<br>
																Some wrapping paper is very thin and contains few good quality fibres for recycling<br>
																A lot of wrapping paper has sticky tape attached to it which makes it very difficult to recycle.<br><br>
																Before recycling, remove any sticky tape and decorations such as ribbons and bows as these cannot be recycled.<br><br>

																Wrapping paper can only be recycled if it passes the scrunch test - simple paper wrap can be recycled but foil or glitter-decorated paper cannot and needs to go in the general waste.

												<p id="blockquote" class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">INHALERS</p>
				  
				   <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">All used inhalers should be returned to a pharmacy to be disposed of safely.<br><br>

																They can be disposed of by the pharmacist with other drugs waste, this is then thermally treated to destroy the greenhouse gases. This environmentally safe disposal route is available at all pharmacies and is paid for by NHS England.<br><br>

																Alternatively it is possible to recycle Inhalers at those pharmacies participating in the GSK scheme. For more information visit the Complete the Cycle website.<br><br>

																Types onf inhalers and how they are recycled<br>
																There are two main types of inhaler, those using pressurised canisters, known as Metered Dose Inhalers or pMDI, and powder inhalers, known as Dry Powder Inhalers or DPI.<br><br>

																The propellants used in pressurised canister inhalers are powerful greenhouse gases. Even after the inhaler is spent significant amounts of these environmentally damaging gases remain in the canister.<br><br>

																While these gases can be extracted cleaned and reused in industrial equipment, such as air conditioning systems, they are being phased out of use in most applications because of their environmental impacts. <br><br>

																The only environmentally safe way to dispose of them is through thermal treatment, such as incineration. Steel and aluminium may be recovered and recycled at some incinerators.<br><br>

																Approximately 73 million inhalers are used in the UK every year*<br>
																Landfill disposal of inhalers is harmful to the environment both in material waste and in greenhouse gas emissions as the residual gas from canisters is released to the atmosphere.<br>
																If every inhaler-user in the UK returned all their inhalers for one year, this could save 512,330 tonnes of CO2eq - the same as a VW Golf car being driven around the world 88,606 times*<br><br>

																	Jewellery and watches are accepted by many charities. They can be recycled or re-sold to raise valuable funds. Always check the list of acceptable items shown on charity bags first - they do vary considerably<br><br>
																	Alternatively, there are on-line organisations like Recycling for Good Causes that accept jewellery and watches, regardless of condition, via the post, for re-sale/recycling to raise funds for national charities and local groups such as scouts and brownies<br><br>
																	When donating your jewellery to charities:<br>
																	Put them in a separate plastic bag to keep them together - otherwise, they may get lost in the sorting process<br>

																		Glass milk bottles<br>
																	Don't put glass milk bottles into a bottle bank or in with your other glass recycling, rinse and return them to your milkman.<br><br>
																	
																	Plastic milk containers<br>
